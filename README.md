🌤️ Introducing My Weather App! 🌦️
I’ve just finished building a simple, interactive weather app that provides real-time weather information based on any city you enter. It's powered by WeatherAPI, and it's a great tool for learning how to fetch data from APIs and display it in a user-friendly way!

Features:
1-Current Weather: Displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions for any city.
2-Real-Time Data: Fetches live data using the WeatherAPI.
3-Responsive Design: The app looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.
4-Search Functionality: You can search by city name to get weather information.
5-Local Time: Displays the local time of the searched city.
